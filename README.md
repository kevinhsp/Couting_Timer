# Couting_Timer
This is a counting down timer, which also includes a circle animation to show the time left, and it is able to let you edit the timer when timer is paused. You can also lap the current timer's time to a list.
When you pause and start, the circle animation will not reset.
When the time is running, you cannot edit the timer but you can lap the time.
When you pause and reduce the time, you will the circle animation also changed, but if you increase the time and let it higher than the time you set at first, the timer will run more than one circle. 
It's simple and intuitive.
